          <h1>what caused the tornado</h1>
          <p>
            On April 1, 1974, a very strong low pressure system developed in the great plains and eventually moved 
            into the Ohio Valley. At the same time a large mass of cold, dry air was dropping down from Canada along
            with a huge surge of unusually warm moist air coming up from the Gulf of Mexico. All of these features 
            converged under an intense jet stream with 140 mph winds at an altitude of around 40,000 feet in the 
            atmosphere.
          </p>
          <p>
            The collision of all of these weather features on April 3 caused warm air to rush up very rapidly as strong jet stream
            winds in the atmosphere were blowing counterclockwise creating the perfect recipe for tornado formation.

          <h1>the storm's track</h1>
          <p>
            The tornado formed southwest of Xenia in Bellbrook Ohio at about 4:30 pm EDT. It began as a moderate sized
            tornado and then intensified as it moved northeast at about 50 mph. The tornado had a multiple vortex
            structure, which is described as multiple funnels coming together and formed one large funnel as it 
            approached Xenia. The huge tornado then slammed into the western part of Xenia and completely flattened
            the Windsor Park and Arrowhead subdivisions at f5 intensity, completely wiping out brick homes and other 
            structures in its path.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the tornado reached central Xenia at 4:40 pm, it was videotaped and observed to have as many as 5
            sub vorticies again merging into one twister. It destroyed commercial buildings, apartment buildings,
            churches, and schools including Xenia High School. Students who were in the school at the time had taken
            cover in the main hallway just seconds before the twister tossed a school bus on top of the stage they were
            practicing for a play on. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As the tornado moved along, it lifted up and blew over railroad cars from a moving Penn Central freight
            train in the center of town. The storm toppled headstones in Cherry Grove Cemetary before moving through
            the downtown business district and passing just west of the courthouse, which sustained some exterior 
            damage. Many of the businesses in the downtown area were extensively damaged or destroyed, along with 
            the local A&W Root Beer stand that was flattened and where 5 people were killed. The tornado then moved 
            on into the Pinecrest Garden District, which was majorly impacted.
          </p>
          <p>
            After exiting Xenia, the tornado passed through Wilberforce, severely damaging several campus buildigs of 
            Wilberforce University. It also ripped through Central State University damaging nearly 80 percent of the
            campus and killing two people and injuring twelve according to the April 9, 1974 edition of the <a href="https://dks.library.kent.edu/?a=d&d=dks19740409-01.2.45&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------" target="_blank">Daily Kent Stater.</a> 
            Afterwards, the tornado weakens and then finally dissipates in Clark County near Vienna. The tornado would 
            later be classified as an F5, the strongest on the Fujita scale with top wind speeds estmated at 250 to 305mph. 
            A document from NOAA's <a href="img/data.jpg" target="_blank" alt="storm data">Storm Data Publication</a>
            indicates that approximately 300 homes were destroyed and around 2100 others were damaged along with much of
            the downtown business district. Many sources also claim that Ted Fujita, the creator of the Fujita scale
            assigned an F6 preliminary rating to the tornado making it one of only two tornados to ever receive the rating 
            and later downgraded the rating to an F5, because he later regarded F6 ratings as inconceivable.

        <p>
          Even today, meteorologists and severe weather experts do not fully understand why tornados form, but they
          do better understand the factors and ingredients that have to come together to create the type of supercell 
          thunderstorms that produce some of the most violent tornados. Fortunately, with better knowledge 
          along with advanced technology, more advanced warnings can be given if or when a tornado will occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tornados are violently rotating columns of air extending from thunderstorms in contact with the ground. They 
          develop when wind variations with height support rotation in the updraft. Warm humid air rises while cool air 
          falls along with rain or hail. The air rising within the thunderstorm can begin to spin when affected by winds
          blowing in different directions.  These features can cause air currents to spin inside of the cloud. These
          spinning currents can start out horizontal and then turn vertical droping to the ground and become a tornado.

        <p>
          It is estimated that an average of 1200 tornados hit the US every year. Typically the highest number of
          tornados occur in a broad area in the central US known as Tornado Alley. However, violent tornados can and do 
          happen outside of this region every year. In fact, tornados can occur and have been reported in every US state.
          Tornados can occur at anytime of the day or night. Typically the most tornados occur between the hours of 4PM 
          and 9PM.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tornados are rated based on the damage they cause and their estimated wind speeds. On February 1, 2007 a new 
          rating scale known as the Enhanced Fujita Scale was formed. This system rates tornado damage more on how 
          structures are designed along with wind estimates, using the 3 second gust at the point of damage to different 
          types of structures. If several different structures matches the damage indicator being considered and matches 
          one of the 8 degrees of damage used by the scale, a tornado evaluator will determine whether the wind speeds that 
          caused the damage is higher or lower than the expected degree of damage value. Once all of these determinations 
          are completed, a final rating can be determined.

    <section id="safety">
      <h1>Difference between a tornado watch and warning</h1>
      <div class="safety-text">
        <p>
          A tornado watch is issued for an area when conditions are favorable for severe weather and tornado activity to
          occur. If a watch is issued for your area, have a plan of action in place and stay tuned to local weather 
          radar and reports throughout the duration of the watch.
        </p>
        <p>
          A tornado warning is issued for an area when either a tornado has been reported by spotters or indicated on 
          radar and there is a serious threat to life and property to those in the path of the tornado. A tornado warning 
          means that you should immediately find safe shelter and take action to protect yourself.
        </p>
        <h1>tornado safety tips</h1>
        <p>
          Most injuries and deaths from tornados are caused from falling or flying debris. While there is no real 
          complete safe place during a tornado there are places you can go and things you can do to protect yourself.
        </p>
          <div class="safety-list">
            <li>Go to the lowest floor of a building such as a basement or center hallway and stay away from windows.</li>
            <li>For added protection, get under something sturdy, such as a heavy table or workbench.</li>
            <li>Cover your whole body with a blanket, sleeping bag, or mattress.</li>
            <li>Protect and cover your head with anything available.</li>
            <li>Do not stay in a mobile home if a tornado warning is issued.</li>
            <li>If you are in a mobile home or outside find the nearest sturdy building.</li>
            <li>Do not try to outrun a tornado in your car.</li>
            <li>If there are no nearby shelters, lie flat in the nearest ditch and cover your head with your hands.</li>
